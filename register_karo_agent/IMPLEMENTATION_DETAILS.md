# RegisterKaro Agent - Implementation Details

## Data Persistence Implementation

### MongoDB Integration

We've implemented MongoDB integration for persistent data storage with the following components:

- **Connection Management**: `database/db_connection.py` provides a singleton MongoDB connection manager
- **Data Models**: `database/models.py` implements the `UserProfile` class for user data persistence
- **Session Management**: User data is stored by session ID for retrieval across visits

The MongoDB implementation stores:
- User profile information (name, email, phone)
- Full conversation history
- Document verification status and results
- Payment status and details
- Context summaries generated by the LLM

### Cloudinary Document Storage

Documents are now stored in Cloudinary with the following implementation:

- **Storage Service**: `storage/cloudinary_storage.py` manages the Cloudinary connection and uploads
- **Document Tools Integration**: `tools/document_tools.py` modified to store documents in Cloudinary
- **Document Persistence**: Uploaded document URLs are stored in MongoDB for future reference

## User Experience Improvements

### UI Updates

The chat interface has been improved with the following changes:

- **Larger Chat Window**: CSS updated to ensure visibility when cards are displayed
- **Payment Card Improvements**: Added a close button and auto-close on payment completion
- **Layout Adjustments**: Dynamic layout adjustments when document upload or payment areas are shown

### Conversation Context Management

- **Context Persistence**: Conversation history stored in MongoDB
- **Context Summarization**: Added functionality to generate and store conversation summaries
- **Session Reconnection**: Support for continuing conversations on user return

## Schema Design

The MongoDB schema uses a single collection (`users`) with a flexible document structure:

```
users
├── session_id: String (primary identifier)
├── name: String (optional)
├── email: String (optional)
├── phone: String (optional)
├── created_at: ISO Timestamp
├── updated_at: ISO Timestamp
├── conversation: Array
│   ├── role: "user" | "assistant"
│   ├── content: String
│   ├── timestamp: ISO Timestamp
│   └── metadata: Object (optional)
├── context_summary: String (updated periodically)
├── context_updated_at: ISO Timestamp
├── document: Object
│   ├── file_path: String (local path)
│   ├── cloudinary_url: String (if Cloudinary is available)
│   ├── cloudinary_public_id: String (if Cloudinary is available)
│   ├── filename: String
│   ├── mime_type: String
│   ├── is_valid: Boolean
│   ├── analysis: String (verification results)
│   └── updated_at: ISO Timestamp
├── payment: Object
│   ├── pending: Boolean
│   ├── completed: Boolean
│   ├── payment_id: String
│   ├── link: String
│   ├── amount: Number
│   ├── currency: String
│   ├── status: String
│   └── updated_at: ISO Timestamp
└── case_outcome: Object
    ├── is_win: Boolean
    ├── reason: String
    └── timestamp: ISO Timestamp
```

## How It Works

1. **Session Creation**: A unique session ID is generated for each user
2. **Data Persistence**: All user interactions are stored in MongoDB
3. **Document Handling**:
   - Documents are uploaded to Cloudinary
   - Document URLs and verification results are stored in MongoDB
   - Document information is associated with the user profile
4. **Payment Processing**:
   - Payment details are stored and tracked in MongoDB
   - Once payment is complete, the payment card auto-closes
   - Case outcome is recorded for business metrics
5. **Context Management**:
   - Conversation history is stored and retrieved from MongoDB
   - Regular summarization keeps context manageable
   - When a returning user is detected, their context is loaded and they're welcomed back

## Testing

- Integration tests for MongoDB and Cloudinary are available in `test_integration.py`
- Tests verify connectivity and basic operations for both services

## Fallback Mechanisms

- If MongoDB connection fails, the application falls back to in-memory storage
- If Cloudinary is unavailable, documents are stored locally

## Future Improvements

1. **Scheduled Context Summarization**: Implement background tasks to regularly summarize long conversations
2. **Enhanced User Recognition**: More robust detection of returning users
3. **Analytics Integration**: Track case outcomes and conversion rates
4. **User Authentication**: Add optional user accounts for better persistence
